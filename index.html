              In July, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing
              the existence of an element they named "polonium", in honour of
              her native Poland.

              On December, the Curies announced the existence of a second
              element, which they named "radium", from the Latin word for "ray".

              International recognition for her work had been growing to new
              heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming
              opposition prompted by the Langevin scandal, honoured her a second

              Curie produced hollow needles containing "radium emanation", a
              colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified
              as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. She provided
              the radium from her own one-gram supply.

              Curie died aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy,
              Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been
              contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, causing
              damage to her bone marrow.

              The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's
              radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to
              contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore
              forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the
              experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest
              Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe
              the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments
              with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In
              medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by
              which cancer could be successfully attacked.
